# Organisation/repository management
## opensource version published on github
- [repository](https://github.com/pixano/pixano-app) opensource under licence [CeCILL-C](./LICENSE.txt)
- contains all modules and codes from SoTA
- version tags : vX.Y.Z
- **never push directly on the github !** You must always go through pull-requests to secure and generate traffic (see [procedure](#procedure-de-publication)).

## internal version published on our gitlab
### remote github branch
- this branch is a local copy of the github repository **fork√©**. It is only used to prepare and do publications (or more rarely to retrieve github code if it is ahead  on the gitlab master).
- for each new version to publish on the github :
	- you prepare it on this branch
	- you test it on this branch
	- you tag it on this branch
	- you push it on your forked github before doing a oull-request on the original repository (see [detailed procedure](#procedure-de-publication))
### master branch
- default branch to retrieve for all new user
- version the most up-to-date, it contains, more than the github functionnalities, all smart functions usable internally and with our partners
- regroup "regularly" the project novelties (except for porjet code which stay proprietary for given company)
- version tags : viX.Y.Z
### other branches
- one branch per project (industrial, thesis, internship)
- each branch comes from master
- all functionnalities or corrections mature enough are push "regularly" on the master (merge or cherry-pick depending on the case)
- at the end of the project, the branch is fused with the master
- version tags (if appropriate) : vipX.Y.Z or specific tag for the partner (eg. vipX.Y.Z_arcure, vipX.Y.Z_valeo, etc)

### schematically :
```
github                                      gitlab  
------                     ---------------------------------------  
                                                    <--merge--> p1  
master  <------push------  github <--merge-- master <--merge--> p2  
                                                    <--merge--> p2  
                                                    ...  
```

## particular case of a repository which must be in tuleap
- the developments linked to the project are done on the tuleap by both the cea and the partners
- push "regularly" novelties from tuleap to the project branch in gitlab
- push "regularly" novelties from the gitlab to the tuleap depending on the need, procedure :
	1. push tuleap to gitlab (project)
	2. merge gitlab master and project branches
	3. push gitlab (project) to tuleap

*We mean by "regularly" : every about 6 months, ideally in september and january. You are of course free to do these merges more often.*

---------------------


# A) Open-source publication procedure
## 1. Prerequisite (only the first time)
#### have a github account and fork
- create a [github](https://github.com) $MYACCOUNT account 
- create a fork of the [original repository](https://github.com/pixano/pixano-app)
#### initialize the repository remote branch
	git remote add upstream git@github.com:$MYACCOUNT/pixano-app.git
	git fetch upstream
	git checkout -b github upstream/master

## 2. On github: Update your fork
- on your fork github (on github.com), click on "Fetch upstream", then "Fetch and merge"

## 3. Locally: Prepate the publication
	# make sure the repositories are up-to-date
	git fetch
	git fetch upstream
	git checkout github
	# integrate our modifications to the github branch
	# a few usage examples with cherry-pick :
	# import of the commit number d5e075f2 :
	git cherry-pick d5e075f2
	# import of all commits from b4cb0b18 to d5e075f2 both included:
	git cherry-pick b4cb0b18^..d5e075f2
	# import of all commits from cfbb3866 (not included) to 74e276acb:
	git cherry-pick cfbb3866..74e276acb : 

During the merge / before commiting, **do not include / delete files and internal/proprietary codes** :  

- do not include the present file [README_INTERNAL.md](./README_INTERNAL.md), nor the .gitlab-ci.yml
- do not include the folder [doc_interne](./doc_interne)
- do not include the files with tag "proprietary"
- do not include with code blocks surrounded by tag "proprietary"

### 4. Verify and validate code
#### clean and recompilation "from scratch"
	# clean
	rm -rf node_modules
	rm package-lock.json frontend/package-lock.json
	# compilation
	npm i
	npm run installApp
	npm run buildApp
#### verify "by hand"
	node server/server.js data-test/

## 5. Publish
#### 1. push
	VERSION=0.4.17
	#update the publication version in the package.json
	git add package.json
	git commit -m "release $VERSION"
	git tag -m "v$VERSION" "v$VERSION"
	# push modifications on the fork
	git push upstream github:master --follow-tags
<!-- LACK IN THE PROCEDURE : tag report on the master -->
<!-- git checkout master -->
<!-- git tag -m "v$VERSION" "v$VERSION" -->
<!-- git push origin master -->
<!-- ISSUE : we cannot have 2 tags of the same name in a given repository even if the other branch is upstream -->
#### 2. pull-request
The rest is on [github](https://github.com) :

- on the fork $MYACCOUNT : onglet "Pull requests" => "New pull request" => "Create pull request" => "Create pull request"
- automatic verifications are made by github
- on the pixano account : got to "Merge pull request" => "Confirm merge"
#### 3. release
Transform the tag in github release (makes the last tag more visible and detailed) :
<!--	DOES NOT WORK (yet)?) because tags are not exported in pull requests-->
<!--	- go to the page [tags](https://github.com/pixano/pixano-elements/tags)-->
<!--	- select the last tag-->
<!--	- "Edit release"-->
<!--	- in "Release title", put the version vX.Y.Z-->
<!--	- "Update release"-->

	- go to the page in [release](https://github.com/pixano/pixano-app/releases)
	- button "Draft a new release"
	- "Tag version" vX.Y.Z
	- in "Release title", put the version vX.Y.Z
	- complete the comments
		- To easily list the commits and descriptions :
			git log v0.5.15..v0.5.16 --oneline
	- "Publish release"

#### 4. push on docker hub
	# login (if not already logged)
	docker login --username pixano --password *****
	# build docker image
	sudo docker build -t  pixano/pixano-app:$VERSION .
	sudo docker tag pixano/pixano-app:$VERSION pixano/pixano-app:latest
	# make sure it built correctly
	cd data-test/
	sudo docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/data --network host pixano/pixano-app:$VERSION
	cd ../
	# push to docker hub
	sudo docker push pixano/pixano-app:$VERSION
	sudo docker push pixano/pixano-app:latest
